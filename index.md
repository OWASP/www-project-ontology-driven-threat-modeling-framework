## What is OdTM?

The ontology-driven threat modelling (OdTM) framework is a set of means for implementation of 
an ontological approach into automatic threat modelling of computer systems.


### Description

The OdTM framework enables formalization of security related knowledge (architectural components and associated threats and countermeasures)
of different computer system types (architectural domains) in form of domain-specific threat models, or ontologies in the OWL (Web Ontology language) format.
That gives a useful way to collect the knowledge by security professionals and share with software architects, developers and users.
Also, the framework allows to describe a computer system in term of a domain-specific threat model with a DFD (data flow diagram), 
and use automatic reasoning procedures to build a threat model (relevant threats and countermeasures) of the system. 
Such a feature makes it easily automation of the threat modelling process.

Our goals are: 
* to maintain a base threat model (ontology) that enables creation of domain-specific threat models;
* to create different domain-specific threat models (for Web applications, Cloud computing, Internet of Things etc.);
* to develop an ontology-driven threat rule engine, and a GUI editor of domain-specific threat models.
